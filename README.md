# Real-estate-Webscrapping-Zolo
In this project, we made a webscrapping of Zolo and grab data for the houses, condos and townhouses in the town of Toronto.
In Zolo cart, we count 827 houses, 1757 Condos, and 312 Town-houses.

We used Selenium for our scrapping because Zolo is a dynamic Website. 
We run a Web driver on google chrome
